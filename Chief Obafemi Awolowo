        <blockquote>After rain comes sunshine; After darkness comes the glorious dawn. There is no sorrow without its alloy of
            joy; there is no joy without its admixture of sorrow. Behind the ugly terrible mask of misfortune lies the
            beautiful soothing countenance of prosperity. So, tear the mask!</blockquote>
